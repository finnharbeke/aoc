hey georg!

how are you doing?
well, as your secret santa i may never get an answer
but i hope you're doing great.

i gotta say, it was my first time buying nail polish.
a kind young woman helped me a bit when i asked her about
the brands and if to buy base coat and or top coat.
hope you like the colors, i like them.

i'm super proud of you and me if this
message ever reached you, coding is sick man

wish you all the best during study phase
and the exams and the entire next year!

ps
this was a pain to write using short
words as to not mega explode the nums haha
i guess they're huge either way...
my bad if that caused struggle, i just
used the first way to make numbers out of
strings that came to my head lol

pps
if you even tried making your own input
that i could then parse i'll read it for sure when
you send it in the secret santa or the aoc channel

ppps
thought about revealing my name here but nah
you can guess or so and then i'll reveal in
due time hehe
